# Learning AI

This repository is a personal notebook to document and summarize key concepts, patterns, and code examples related to **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning**.

The goal is to create a structured collection of notebooks that not only explain theoretical concepts (e.g., datasets, neural networks, LLMs) but also include practical code snippets, small projects, and pattern recognition techniques.

## Getting started

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samugd17/learning-ai.git
cd learning-ai
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv --prompt learningAI

source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìå Notes

This repository is designed to grow progressively.

Future sections will include hands-on projects, dataset manipulations, neural network implementations, and more advanced AI patterns.
